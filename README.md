# treehouse-jquery-lightbox

Take 2. 

This project was a good learning experience for me. I found javascript and jquery more challenging than css and html.

To make the project a bit more visually appealing I decided to use some of my own images instead of those provided and give it a theme (Winter in Norway) so as to add a little more interest to the project.

After getting feedback that I should use the images provided and stick to the brief, I had to update my project. It's a lot more boring now and not as visually appealing.

I have used the Fancybox jquery plugin for the gallery and lightbox which was very easy to use and I had no problem with setting it all up.

I wanted to challenge myself with the search filter and use my own jquery. The first bit - filtering the search was easier than expected but then I suddenly realised that although the thumbnails were filtering, the lightbox images were not filtering. It took a bit of fiddling but i figured it out. I got rid of a little bug that was resetting the image if you pressed the enter key once you entered your search term. But the part that I got really stuck on was figuring out how to display a message if there were no matching images for the search term. I got there eventually and I think I learnt a LOT in the process.

The site is responsive and has 4 break points which relate to the image columns.

I have tested the site in Firefox, Chrome and Safari on Mac, as well as iphone and ipad. It all seems to work!!
